# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
Our goal in this assignment is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets regarding Greek elections classifying them as positive or negative or neutral experimenting with different models.The datasets have the following columns ; 'New ID' for the record id, 'Text' for the tweet and 'Party' for the political party the tweet refers to and 'Sentiment' which is the label.

## FNN with Word Embeddings


## Bidirectional RNN 
- In this approach, we implement a  Bidirectional RNN experimenting on the number of stacked RNNs ,the number of hidden layers , type of cells (LSTM/ GRU) , skipping connections , gradient clipping , multihead attention and dropout probability.This time, we perform padding in the batches to ensure the sequential data processing needed in the model.
